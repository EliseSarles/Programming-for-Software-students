# Programming-for-Software-students
My name is Elise Sarles. I am from Panguitch highschool and I am talking CSCI courses from Southwest Tec. 
This repository is for my school assangments and to help perpare me for the future. Github is one of the major used sites in the indstery of computer programming and other feilds. It is good to learn how to use it while in highschool. 
I see myself as a hardworking school who enjoys theater, phycology, and technology. Continueing with school, I hope to get the highest education I can in all those fields. I am an excitable person and spend most of my free time reading or painting. 
I am talking this program to learn about how and why computers and applications run and use it to the benefit of both myself and others.
