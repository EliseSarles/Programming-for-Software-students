# Programming-for-Software-students
My name is Elise Sarles. I am from Panguitch highschool and I am taking CSCI courses from Southwest Tec. 
This repository is for my school assignments and to help prepare me for the future. Github is one of the major used sites in the industry of computer programming and some other fields. Itâ€™s for the best to learn how to use it while in highschool. 
I see myself as a hardworking student who enjoys theater, psychology, and technology. While continuing with school, I hope to get the highest education I can in all those fields. I am an excitable person and spend most of my free time reading or painting. 
I am taking this program to learn about how and why computers and applications run. Then use it to the benefit of both myself and others.
